### DOJ MDT made with React / qbox.
- Still under development (Dashboard & Citizen tabs fully work (or nearly, still tweaking here and there). Other views will be pushed once written)

## Views 
- Dashboard : basic information displayed here (chat, profile info, search and duty list etc)
- Citizens : A citizen tab where you'd see server citizens + their profiles
- Dockets : Every docket in the server will be listed here
- Reports : might remove this tbh (or not? if I make this all in one tablet or not)
- Warrants : A warrant system will be in the mdt, justices will approve/deny warrants and send back to pd
- Legislations : Penal code and other legislations can be modified here directly and sent back to pd (will be wired up at some point)
- Management : Justice management system (Justice finances, roster management etc)
- Finances : player bank accounts, transactions etc will be here. Can be viewed only when warrants are approved, exported and sent to pd.

- [Might make this an all in one tablet that supports DOJ & PD]
