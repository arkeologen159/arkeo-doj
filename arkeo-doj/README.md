### MDT made with React / qbox.
- Still under development, only dashboar is done (or nearly) for now, other features will be added once finished
## Summary 
- Tabs system : just like on a browser
- Dashboard : basic information displayed here (chat, profile info, search and statuses/employee list etc)
- Citizens : A citizen tab where you'd see citizens + their profiles
- Dockets : Court dockets will be listed here (templates, create dockets, view them etc)
- Reports : might remove this tbh (or not? if I include pd and make it an all in one mdt, will not remove it)
- Warrants : A warrant system will be in the mdt, justices will approve/deny warrants and send back to pd
- Legislations : Penal code and other legislations can be modified here directly and sent back to pd (will be wired up at some point)
- Management : Justice management system (Justice finances, roster management etc)
- Finances : player bank accounts, transactions etc will be here. Can be viewed only when warrants are approved, exported and sent to pd.

- [More likely than not, will change this up to an MDT supporting DOJ & PD, all in one, view/permissions will depend on rank]
